 Welcome to the Skin Observer Android Application.
 
 This is a android mobile application that lets the user take regular pictures of their acne or skin other skin conditions.
 The photos are kept in a local database that the doctor can use to track their patient's skin conditions over time. 
 The application has alarm systems to remind user to take regular pictures. Patients can also categorize different
 skin conditions and specific photos so that the doctor can be aware of what condition the pictures refer to.
